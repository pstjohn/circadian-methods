CommonFiles - A collection of python codes to assist with the development and
analysis of deterministic limit cycle models for circadian rhythms

Files:

pBase.py - a wrapping of the older Periodic and casadi functions for basic
limit cycle calculations

Collocation.py - implements the collocation method of parameter and limit cycle estimation for a SX model given time-series data

Identifiability.py - wraps the Collocation.py implementation to determine sensitivity and parameter identifiability as a function of data quality

ModelTools.py - a collection of basic object-oriented tools for the creation and
manipulation of ODE models.
